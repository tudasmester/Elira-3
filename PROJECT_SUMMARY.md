# Elira Platform - Complete Project Summary

## Project Description

Elira is a sophisticated Hungarian online education platform designed to deliver personalized, modular learning experiences. The platform specializes in comprehensive course and exam management with advanced quiz capabilities integrated directly into the course content workflow.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🔐 Authentication System
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- User registration and login with email/password
- Admin role management and verification
- Profile management and password updates
- Session management with token blacklisting

### 📚 Course Management
- Hierarchical course structure (Courses → Modules → Lessons)
- Rich course metadata (descriptions, images, pricing, categories)
- Module organization with status management
- Lesson creation with multiple content types (text, video, quiz, file)
- Course publishing and highlighting controls

### 🎯 Integrated Quiz System
- **Revolutionary Approach**: Quizzes embedded within lesson workflow, not standalone
- Multiple question types: multiple choice, true/false, short text, long text, file upload
- Comprehensive quiz settings: time limits, passing scores, attempt limits
- Question option management with correct answer tracking
- Quiz preview and validation capabilities

### 👨‍💼 Administrative Tools
- Complete admin panel for course management
- Course creation and editing with real-time validation
- Module and lesson management with drag-and-drop ordering
- Quiz management integrated within lesson editor
- Content publishing workflow and controls

### 🎨 User Interface
- Modern React-based interface in Hungarian language
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- LearnWorlds-inspired aesthetic and functionality
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- Intuitive course builder with tabbed interface

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible component library
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Stack
- **Express.js** with TypeScript for API server
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data persistence
- **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations
- **JWT** for stateless authentication
- **bcrypt** for secure password hashing

### Database Design
- **6 core tables**: users, courses, modules, lessons, quizzes, quiz questions
- **Foreign key relationships** maintaining data integrity
- **Indexes optimized** for performance
- **JSON columns** for flexible settings storage

## Unique Innovation: Integrated Quiz Workflow

Unlike traditional LMS platforms with standalone quiz builders, Elira implements quiz functionality directly within the course content creation workflow:

1. **Course-Centric Design**: All quiz creation happens within course building
2. **Lesson Integration**: Quizzes are created as part of lesson content, not separate features
3. **Contextual Management**: Quiz management embedded in lesson editor tabs
4. **Workflow Efficiency**: Eliminates need for separate quiz building interfaces
